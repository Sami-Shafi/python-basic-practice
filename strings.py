# Strings in python are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks. Let's look at string formatting and some string methods

name = "sami"
age = 16
# print("Hey, It's " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")

# String Formatting
# print("Hey, My name is {name} and I am {age}.".format(name=name, age=age))
# print(f"Hey, My name is {name} and I am {age}.")

# String Methods
# capitalize
# print(f"Capitalize: {name.capitalize()}")
# print(f"UpperCase: {name.upper()}")
# print(f"LowerCase: {name.lower()}")
# print(f"split: {name.split()}")
# print(f"String Length is {len(name)}")
# print(f"'{name}' has {name.count('s')} s.")
